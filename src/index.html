                <h3>Autonomous Door Opener</h3>
                <p>Autonomous door opener using a Raspberry Pi 3b, camera, and a stepper motor.</p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this project was to make a device that will watch the outside of my door and
                    use a deep learning model to determine if the person at the door is authorized to enter.
                    After an authorized person is detected, the stepper motor will open the door.
                </p>
                <p>The first step of the project was getting the hardware set up and working.</p>
                <p>
                    I chose to use a Raspberry Pi as the main controller because I already had it
                    and it can run the camera, deep learning model, and stepper motor. The camera
                    I used was an official Raspberry Pi camera module because it is small and can
                    connect to the Pi easily. The motor I used was a bipolar stepper motor that
                    was harvested from a broken 3d printer. I purchased an EasyDriver stepper motor
                    driver to control the motor. Other components such as power supplies and
                    jumper wires were also used. To get the hardware working, I had to connect the
                    camera and motor to the Pi. A diagram of the motor wiring can be found below.
                </p>
                <img src="img/circuit.png" class="img-fluid">
                <p><strong>Diagram generated by Circuit.io</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Important things to note about the diagram: <br> Seperate power supplies were used
                    for the Pi and the motor. The motor power supply has the positive lead connected to
                    the motor driver power and the ground is connected to the motor driver ground as well
                    as the Pi ground. The motor driver STEP and DIR pins are connected to the Pi GPIO pins
                    to control the motor. Lastly, the A and B motor leads are connected to the motor driver.
                    After the motor driver is fully wired, the motor can be tested using a simple Python
                    script included in the github repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the hardware is set up, the software can be completed. My main aspiration
                    for this project was to get the deep learning model working. An Important
                    aspect to consider for this project was the hardware limitations of the Pi.
                    With no hardware acceleration and only 1GB of RAM, the model would have to be
                    very lightweight. I chose to use the MobileNet model as a base model because
                    it can fit in the Pi's memory and it is fast. After downloading the model,
                    I implemented transfer learning with my own custom dataset of authorized
                    people. The dataset is compiled from images I have taken of myself. The
                    dataset is small consisting of around 100 images. Another label used for
                    training was the "unauthorized" label. This label was created to capture
                    anything that is not me. After training, the model reports about 90% testing
                    accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a trained model has been saved, then the main application can be completed.
                    I created a class called MotorDriver that uses the RPi.GPIO library to control
                    the motor. The class has methods to open and close the door. Another class called 
                    ImageClassifier takes a model path and a MotorDriver object as arguments. This 
                    class is responsible for loading the model weights and making predictions. After 
                    the model is loaded a loop is started which takes a picture from the camera and
                    makes a prediction using the model. If the prediction is "authorized" then the
                    MotorDriver object is called to open the door. The loop continues until the program
                    is stopped.
