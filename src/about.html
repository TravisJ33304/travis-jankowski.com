    <p class="content">
        Hi! <br> <br>
        I'm a sophmore at the Milwaukee School of Engineering studying Computer Science. <br>
        My journey with technology started when I got my first computer at age 10.
        Then in middle school I started learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make simple games with my friend. 
        In high school I took the AP computer science courses and learned how to make full stack web applications and java applications. 
        In my senior year I accepted an internship at Kaukauna Utilities and the City of Kaukauna in Information Technology. 
        Throughout the internship I learned about server administration, enterprise networking, and government cybersecurity standards. 
        After my internship I started at MSOE and continued developing my skills with computers. 
        During my first year I attended the school career fair and networked with companies. After interviewing with several companies I accepted an internship with Cognex corporation.
        At Cognex I became a software engineering intern and learned what it was like to develop software in the industry. 
        I'm still learning and growing every day as a software engineer and I'm excited to see where my career takes me.
